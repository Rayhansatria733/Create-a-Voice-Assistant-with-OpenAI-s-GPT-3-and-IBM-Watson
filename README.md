## Author: @ Talha Siddiqui , @ Rohit Arora
### Mentee assignment from IBM Advance AI @ Infinite Learning Course completation. In this guided project, I learn how to build my own AI assistant using OpenAI's pre-trained GPT-3 model. Unlike the popular ChatGPT which communicates with text, my personal assistant will use voice. I use Watson Speech-to-Text to give your AI assistant the gift of hearing and Watson Text-to-Speech so that my assistant can read the answers back to me.
